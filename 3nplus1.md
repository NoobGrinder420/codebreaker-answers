<b>3nplus1</b>

The 3n+1 sequence is generated as follows. Starting from a number n, we get the next number in the sequence by doing this:

- If n is even, the next number is n/2.
- If n is odd, the next number is 3n+1.

We continue this way until we reach 1.

Your task is: given nâ‰¤10000, generate the sequence.
